Whats the fun?
=============
You're on the move and suddenly you need those calcuations you made last night in your Google Docs spreadsheet?
Well this app is for you, Online Docs lets you to login with a Google Account and view files in Google Docs.
Whats more, You can view your online docs, download them and view them in the native Office viewer.

Using this app you can get whatever documents you want, in few taps without having to open a browser:)

This app is designed to work with a Harmattan device such as N9/N950.

Note
-------------
Currently the app only fetches accounts from the Harmattan Accounts service, the user still has to enter the password.
I am trying to figure out how to use the SSO API properly, any help appreciated!
